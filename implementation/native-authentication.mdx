1. In your `src` directory, create a `hooks.server.ts` file
```TypeScript
// Import if you would like to utilize native user registration and login
import { SvaultNative } from 'svault';


// Set redirect path to your desired endpoint upon user login
const redirectPath = '/[yourPathHere]'; //ex. 'const redirectPath = '/homepage'


// Svault native handler
export const handle = SvaultNative(redirectPath);
```
2. Create a PostgreSQL table with the following columns:
```SQL
CREATE TABLE [YOURTABLENAME] (
    username VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR NOT NULL,
)
```
3. In your `routes` directory, create a route called `login`. In your login `+page.svelte`, create form elements for taking in username and password inputs. Create buttons for login and register.
    - Ensure the endpoints are set to `registerValidate` and `loginValidate`
    - Create a separate button that is set to `logout` endpoint
```TypeScript
// Example routes/login/+page.svelte

<form method="post">
    <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Username"
        name="username"
        required
    />
    <input
        type="password"
        placeholder="Password"
        name="password"
        required
    />

    <button type="submit" formaction="?/registerValidate">
        Register
    </button>
    <button type="submit" formaction="?/loginValidate">
        Login
    </button>
  </form>
```
```TypeScript
// To implement logout functionality, create a button or anchor tag in your page.svelte that redirects to '/logout'

<button>
    <a href="/logout">Logout</a>
</button>
```
4. In your `.env` file (create if you haven't done so) that takes in your database URI and user table name
```TypeScript
// Paste if using native authentication with a PostgreSQL database
PG_URI = YOURDATABASEURI
TABLE_NAME = YOURTABLENAME //ex. TABLE_NAME = users

//MAX_AGE will determine the expiration time of the user's session
MAX_AGE = Date.now() + {someNumberHere} * {someNumberHere}
// ex. Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 --> session will last for 1 hour
```
5. After submitting the form, the user will be redirected to the endpoint of your choice.
    - Upon registering, the user will be added to the database with the username and a secure hashed password.
    - On login, the user will be authenticated through your database.
    - A browser cookie will be created as well as a session in local memory storage called "svault-auth".

    - The session will have an expiration time determined in your `.env` file.
    - Sessions will automatically be cleaned and deleted upon expiration.
    - On logout, the user will be redirected to the home page, the cookie will be deleted from the browser, and the session will be deleted from local memory store.
