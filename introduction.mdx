## Features

- Svault is an open-source developer library that simplifies the authentication process in SvelteKit projects.
- Svault is flexible and lightweight, and allows the developer to decide which authentication types they would like to deploy in their application.
- With native username/password authentication, implementing registration and login functionality have never been easier. Cookies and sessions are automatically created and deleted upon logout or expiration.
- Svault also supports OAuth with a number of providers. Currently, it offers easy setup with Google, Github, and Discord, with more providers to come.
- Bonus: Svault provides premade component buttons for implementing OAuth!
- Currently, Svault's database adapter connects to the developer's PostgreSQL database, with additional database functionality in the works.
